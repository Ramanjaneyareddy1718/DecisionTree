# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

This repository showcases a machine learning project using a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. The project uses the popular **Wine Quality dataset** and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision-making process.

## üß† Overview

A **Decision Tree** is a tree-like model used for classification and regression. In this project, we use it to classify wine quality (score from 0 to 10) based on chemical attributes like alcohol content, acidity, pH, etc.

This project includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Training a Decision Tree model
- Evaluating performance using metrics
- Visualizing the trained tree

## üéØ Objective

To predict the **quality of wine** using a Decision Tree classifier and understand how each feature influences the outcome.
